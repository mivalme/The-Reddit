## Let's start üöÄ

_These instructions allow you to obtain a copy of the project in operation on your local machine to be able to test._

### Requirements üìã

_CocoaPods Installed_

### Setup üîß

_Clone this repository on your local machine_

_Open the terminal, and go to the project path_

```
cd projectPath
```

_Install the project pods_

```
pod install
```
_Go to the folder where you cloned the project and open **Posts App.xcworkspace**_

## How is the app built? ‚öôÔ∏è

### Deployment Info ‚å®Ô∏è

* iOS Deployment Target:  _iOS 16.4_
* Targeted Device Family:  _iPhone_
* Swift Language Version:  _Swift implementing UIKit for interfaces_

### Architecture ‚å®Ô∏è

_The app was developed under the VIPER architecture because it:_

* _Offers high scalability_
* _Divide the application components according to their role_
* _Ease of adding new features_
* _Mark responsibilities clearly_
* _Makes unit test development easier as UI logic separates from business logic_
* _Apply SOLID principles_

### Unit Testing ‚å®Ô∏è

_The unit test was developed implementing dependencies injection design pattern. The files tested for each module are presenter and interactor._

### Third-party library ‚å®Ô∏è

__Alamofire__

_Alamofire is a networking library written in Swift. You use it to make HTTP(S) requests on iOS, macOS and other Apple platforms._

__Lottie__

_Lottie is a native iOS, Android, and React library that processes After Effects animations in real time, 
allowing applications to use animations as easily as they use static images. 
So it has become a benchmark for including animations in native applications. 
In addition, the files it processes to run the animation are very light (.json)._

__SDWebImage__

_This library provides an async image downloader with cache support._
